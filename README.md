# Project_Doppelganger_v2
bot that imitates my friend Tritin and integrate with ChatGPT

please note that the personality traits in personality.txt is not accurate.
I've added fake personalities to make the bot spicier and talk less so that I can save up money since CHATGPT API costs money per run.

Tritin's real personality is actually a lot worse (just kidding)

TODO:
make the bot always agree with certain people and always disagree with certain people
